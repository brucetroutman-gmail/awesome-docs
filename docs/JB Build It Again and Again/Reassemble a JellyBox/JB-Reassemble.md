# JellyBOX  - Build it Again and Again             

## **_Re-Building the JellyBOX_**

One of the most exciting features of the JellyBOX 3D printer (JB) for a classroom setting is the ability to build it and rebuild it many times with different classes. Initially, a team builds the JB then prints things that they download or design themselves. At the end of the term, the next class should be able to repeat the process. This ability to rebuild the JB makes it the best value educational printer on the market.

Building a JB Again and Again consists of two phases: Un-Building (disassemble) and Re-Building (reassemble).

Both phases of the process should be done by the entering class. The class will rebuild the JB in an orderly way so the printer runs in an optimal way.  Allow an adequate amount of time, two to four hours, for the reassembly. Correct reassembly will help the printer to run smoothly and create excellent quality prints.


Step 1. **What you will need.**  
 
- 1 Disassembled JellyBOX in a large box

Step 2. **Assemble the Bottom and Two Sides.** Get the 3 larger storage bags labeled **JB Bottom, JB Left Side, **and** JB Right Side.**†Attach cable ties to secure the Bottom to the Left Side and secure the Bottom to the Right Side. Clip the ends of the cable ties and remove any extra blue tape on the acrylic pieces.  \

Step 4. **Assemble the X-Axis.**†Get the storage bag labeled **JB X-Axis.** Attach the cable ties that hold the right side rod then the left side rod. Arrange all wires that are attached to the X-Axis carriage so they drape over the Inner Back. Slide the X-Axis carriage back and forth to ensure that all wires move smoothly. Using the etched diagram thread the wires along the path and through the wire comb.  \

Step 5. **Connect the Arduino and Rep Rap Ramp connectors.** 
> Connect the green 12 Volt block plug into the bottom left connector of the Ramp.† Insert the D9 and D10 pins into their positive (**+**) and negative (**-**) ports (If you have a heated bed, also connect the D8 pins).  Then, using a small flat head screw driver, screw the holders down. †Connect the X, Y, and Z end stop connectors in their labeled positions. Connect the T0 connector in its labeled position (If you have a heated bed, Connect T1 also).  Connect the E, X, Y, and Z motor connectors in their labeled positions. Connect the black USB-B plug into the port in the top left corner of the Arduino. Attach cable ties to secure the wires in place so they are organized and easily identifiable. \

6. **Assemble the Z Motor.**†Get the storage bag labeled **JB Z-Motor.** Wipe the Z-motor screw with a paper towel as it might be greasy. Turn the JellyBOX printer on its side and, using the larger 2.5 mm hex wrench, tighten the 2 screws through the Bottom into the Z motor. Align the X/Z Coupler and the X motor then insert and tighten the 2 screws. It helps if someone holds the X-Axis to release pressure while screwing. †(Be sure that the lock washers are on all the screws). \
